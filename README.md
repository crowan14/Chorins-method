# Chorins-method

Numerical solution to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on square domain with velocity boundary conditions. Pressure Poisson problem is solved with the finite elemenet method and the velocity field is updated with finite difference method.

Finite element method uses a MATLAB toolbox called calfem. Calfem can be downloaded at: https://github.com/CALFEM/calfem-matlab/tree/master/fem.
